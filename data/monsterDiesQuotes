As the fiend falls, a faint hope blossoms.
Confidence surges as the enemy crumbles!
Press this advantage, give them no quarter!
Their formation is broken - maintain the offensive.
Continue the onslaught! Destroy. Them. All.
Executed with impunity!
Another abomination cleansed from our lands.
Begone, fiend!
Back to the pit!
Another one falls!
Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
