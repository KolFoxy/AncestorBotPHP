The abyss is made manifest!
The bulwarks of the mind have fallen!
Madness - sublimity of the intelligence, or so it has been said.
One can sometimes find clarity in madness, but only rarely...
Madness, our old friend!
Even the aged oak will fall to the tempest's winds.
The mind cannot hope to withstand such an assault.
Wherefore, heroism?
The human mind - fragile like a robin's egg.
