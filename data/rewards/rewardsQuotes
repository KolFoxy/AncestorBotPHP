Finding the stuff is only the first test. Now it must be carried home.
Glittering gold, trinkets and baubles. Paid for in blood.
Wealth beyond measure... Awarded to the brave and the foolhardy alike.
If only treasure could staunch the flow of otherworldy corruption...
A handsome reward, for a task well performed.
Fortune, waiting to be spent.
