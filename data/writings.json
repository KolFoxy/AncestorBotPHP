Let's just say I'm now something starting with an F and really like transformation porn now. Well the thing is it wasn't an art piece. Hell, it wasn't even porn. It was a scene from movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Sepcifically, the scene where that bratty rich girl grows into a giant rolling blue ball. Now, I have already confirmed that I do not have an inflation fetish. While it is close to transformation, it wasn't the thing that turned me on. It was her growing and turning blue. When I first saw it, I thought of nothing. But my mind drifted for a few seconds and I saw myself masturbating to the thought of turning into a horrifying monsterous blue ball. My god, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had the best masturbation session in my entire life. I came and came and came some more. I came all over my desk and floor. I did it once now I crave for more. Transformation is a fetish I now adore. I'm already deep down this rabbit hole, but I thought I would just get this out of my system.``[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/furrypasta/comments/bs2yqo/confession_from_a_transformation_server/)",
