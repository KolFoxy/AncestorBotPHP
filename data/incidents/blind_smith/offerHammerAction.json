    "description": "He doesn\'t seem to notice you and doesn\'t care when you pick the tool up. He is still immobile when you go to the opposite side of the anvil and present it to him. After a minute or so of waiting for something to happen, the weight of the hammer forces you to put it down on the anvil. And as soon as you release your grasp from the handle, the man suddenly animates, takes the hammer and strikes the anvil with such force that the sound almost deafens you. He looks at the hammer and the anvil, breathing rapidly and hunching, as if he was holding his breath all this time. You notice the teal glow from his eyes disappearing, and with it, his image becomes blurry and less transparent and soon enough it disappears, leaving you to question if it was just a mirage.\nFor whatever reason, you feel a sense of relief.",
