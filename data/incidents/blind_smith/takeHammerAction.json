    "description": "The hammer is a lot heavier than the size might suggest. It may not even be worth it to drag it along with you. However, as soon as you cross the edge of the smithery foundation, you feel the weight of the hammer disappearing, as the hammer itself crumbles and falls into pieces of wood, metal and rust. You turn around, and see the same thing happening to the man and the whole place. Soon enough, you're standing in front of nothing."
