You try to close your eyes but the image still stays. After long excruciating minutes of staring into your own eyes, the image finally shifts. You see yourself in the mirror. The surface is perfectly clear and you are finally able to move. The frame of the mirror and everything around you have shifted its colors to new, unnatural, maddening ones.');
